# Network Addresses

Network addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network. They are crucial for routing data to the correct destination. There are two main types of network addresses:

*   **MAC (Media Access Control) Address:** A physical address hardcoded into the network interface card (NIC) of a device. It is a 48-bit address, typically represented as six pairs of hexadecimal characters (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E). MAC addresses are used for communication within the same local network.

*   **IP (Internet Protocol) Address:** A logical address assigned to a device on a network. It can be static or dynamic.
    *   **IPv4:** The most common type of IP address, consisting of a 32-bit address, typically represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    *   **IPv6:** A newer, 128-bit address format designed to replace IPv4, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Other important concepts related to network addresses include:

*   **Subnet Mask:** Used to divide a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. It defines which part of the IP address is the network portion and which is the host portion.
*   **Default Gateway:** The IP address of the router that connects a local network to the internet or other networks.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.
