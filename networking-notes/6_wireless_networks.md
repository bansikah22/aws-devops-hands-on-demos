# Wireless Networks

Wireless networks use radio waves to connect devices without the need for physical cables. They provide mobility and convenience, allowing users to access the network from anywhere within the coverage area.

## Key Concepts

*   **Wi-Fi:** The most common wireless networking technology, based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
*   **Access Point (AP):** A device that broadcasts a wireless signal, allowing devices to connect to the network.
*   **SSID (Service Set Identifier):** The name of a wireless network.
*   **Wireless Security:** It is crucial to secure wireless networks to prevent unauthorized access. Common security protocols include:
    *   **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** An older, less secure protocol.
    *   **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** An improvement over WEP.
    *   **WPA2/WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2/3):** The current standards for wireless security, offering strong encryption.
*   **Cellular Networks:** Wireless networks used by mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. They are provided by mobile carriers and use technologies like 4G LTE and 5G.
*   **Bluetooth:** A short-range wireless technology used to connect devices like keyboards, mice, headphones, and smartwatches.
*   **NFC (Near Field Communication):** A very short-range wireless technology used for mobile payments and data transfer between devices that are in close proximity.

Wireless networks have become an integral part of our daily lives, both at home and in the workplace.
